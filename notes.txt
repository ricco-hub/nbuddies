Units:
    mass = M_solar
    distance = kpc
    velocity = km/s

Weeks:
    Week 2:
        Units might become an issue
        To do:
            Create tests
            Make separate branch for my own work, main will be pulled from project leaders' contributions
    Week 3:
        IC's need to be updated to include accelerations in black hole class
        Add comments for justification of algorithms/changes to code from previous week
        Pint units might give us issues
        Time steps group: saving all time steps at each time step
        Binary ICs group: combining all other group's work into one place for two black holes
        Only assigning units to G but nowhere else (like to positions and velocities) ->
            should we just return magnitude of values w/constants or attach units to everything?
        Project leader for this week
        2 reviewers have git merge ability (not including person that made PR)
        To do:
            Create graphic visualizing positions of cluster particles over time
